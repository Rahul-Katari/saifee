                  <span className="text-theme">REALITY:</span>Surgery for weight
                  reduction is not a miracle procedure. Weight loss surgery is
                  designed to assist the morbidly obese in developing a
                  healthier lifestyle. A surgical weight loss operation is a
                  useful tool for weight loss, but it is a surgical procedure
                  that requires a substantial lifelong commitment. The surgery
                  alone will not help someone lose weight and keep it off. The
                  patient must change eating and exercise habits. Without
                  changes to the daily pattern of eating and activity, the
                  patient is likely to regain weight over time. You’ll need to
                  attend educational classes and support groups to work on
                  developing new, lifelong healthy habits and behaviours. Above
                  all, you’ll need to maintain a commitment to reach and
                  maintain a weight that keeps you healthy.

                  <span className="text-theme">REALITY:</span>Obese and morbidly
                  obese people suffer from a disease called obesity. Most have
                  tried numerous ways to lose weight and get healthy but were
                  unsuccessful. Weight loss surgery is usually the last resort,
                  but a necessary option. Unfortunately, many obese people
                  suffer discrimination and unwarranted scrutiny and judgment

                  surgery has associated risks, such as complications or even
                  death. But a number of recent advances have helped to minimize
                  risks. Surgeries performed at the Asian Institute of
                  Gastroenterology are done laparoscopically with mini-incisions
                  that result in faster healing, less pain, and less scarring.
                  In addition, having the procedure may assist patients in
                  overcoming otherwise life-threatening conditions associated
                  with obesity, including Type II diabetes, hypertension, high
                  cholesterol and sleep apnea.
