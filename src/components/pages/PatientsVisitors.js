                expenses incurred due to illness, injury, or preventive care. At

                providers to facilitate billing and reimbursement for eligible
                services.

                    received, medications prescribed, and follow-up care
                    instructions. It is essential to review this plan carefully
                    and ask any questions you may have to ensure clarity and

                    Before scheduling surgery, patients are required to undergo
                    a consultation with one of our specialized surgeons. During
                    this consultation, the surgeon will assess your medical

                    appropriate surgical approach for your needs.

                    Following the consultation, patients may be required to
                    undergo pre-operative tests and evaluations to ensure they
                    are medically fit for surgery. These tests may include blood
                    tests, imaging studies, and consultations with other
