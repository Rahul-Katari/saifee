            What is Hormone Replacement Therapy?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is a treatment that aims to
            replenish hormone levels in the body, restoring balance and
            alleviating symptoms associated with hormonal imbalances. It
            involves the use of medications containing hormones like oestrogen,
            progesterone, or testosterone to supplement the body's natural
            hormone production.

            Benefits of Hormone Replacement Therapy

            <li>

              and reduce the risk of osteoporosis, a condition characterized by
              brittle bones.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Heart Health:</strong> For some individuals, HRT may help
              lower the risk of heart disease by improving cholesterol levels
              and blood vessel function.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Improved Sleep:</strong> Restoring hormonal balance with
              HRT can lead to better sleep patterns and increased energy levels.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Enhanced Well-being:</strong> By addressing hormonal
              imbalances, HRT can improve mood, cognitive function, and overall
              sense of well-being.
